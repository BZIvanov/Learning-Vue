# .NET

## Running the application

We need to be in the API folder where the Program.cs file for our application is placed. When there run in the terminal:

```bash
dotnet run
```

## Working with Visual Studio Code

If you are working with VS code you will need the following extensions:

- **C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp)** - must install
- **NuGet Package Manager** - for installing packages
- **C# Extensions** - optional, but good to have
- **SQLite** - for database, good to have

## Additional notes

When working with the CLI, only creating class library is not enough, we also need to add the library to our solution file.
