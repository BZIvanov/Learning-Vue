Learning materials related to Vue.js

## Usage

We can use Vue in 2 ways:

- installing the CLI
- adding it as a script in the html

## Vue CLI

Read the [official docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html#release-notes) or run the below commands in the terminal.

Install once the cli globally. With the second line you should be able to see the installed version.

```
npm install -g @vue/cli
vue --version
```

And every next time, when creating new project run the following:

```
vue create app-name-here
```

## VSCode extension

Search for extension called "Vetur" and install it so vs code can work well with vue files.
