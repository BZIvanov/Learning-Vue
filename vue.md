## slot

Slot is similar to children in React. With slots we can use the content between component tags.

If we are using more than 1 slot, we can also name them to know which is which. If slot if left nameless it is the default slot, any other has to be named.

Sugar syntax for using slots is the # symbol. So instead of v-slot:item we can write just #item.
